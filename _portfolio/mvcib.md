Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite & Beyond is a fan-made mod that completely overhauls the game Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite in many aspects.

I started the project in May 2024 by creating tools and the initial artstyle, got Maximilian Dood's attention, and helped form the team of 40+ members. The mod was released in December 2024.

Notable features include:

- A brand new cel-shaded art style inspired by comics
- New textures for every character in the game
- Adjusted models for some characters
- Rebalanced gameplay
- New modes involving four players
