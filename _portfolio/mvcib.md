Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite & Beyond is a fan-made mod that completely overhauls the game Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite in many aspects.

Notable features include a new cel-shaded art style, optional gameplay rebalancing, and new game modes.

I started the project in May 2024 with tools and the initial artstyle, got Maximilian Dood's attention, and helped form the team of 40+ members. The mod was released in December 2024.
