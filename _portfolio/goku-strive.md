A mod that puts Goku from Dragon Ball FighterZ in Guilty Gear -Strive-, complete with accurate gameplay to the source game. Unique mechanics in Dragon Ball FighterZ, such as super dash, vanish, and smash hits were ported over.

I made this mod in a week, and it caught traction immediately. Goku did not replace any characters, instead being his own character slot. Additionally, he was usable online against other players with the mod.
