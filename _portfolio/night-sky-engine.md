Night Sky Engine is a free and open source fighting game framework made in Unreal Engine 5. It is designed to be powerful yet easy to learn, and can be used to make 2D and 2.5D fighting games.

I have been programming it since mid-2022, with almost all of the code being solely by me. It includes industry-standard features such as rollback netcode and cross-platform determinism.
