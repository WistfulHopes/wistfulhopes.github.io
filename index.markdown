  The website of Aeryn Mu, known on the internet as WistfulHopes.<br />
---

My name is Aeryn Mu. I'm also known as Ryn, and my online handle is WistfulHopes. I'm a programmer and artist who works in game development and modding.

I'm a generalist who knows Unreal Engine and Unity. I can program in C++, C#, and Python as a gameplay and tools developer. I have written my own fighting game framework in Unreal Engine 5 with support for industry standard features such as rollback netcode. Additionally, I have made a plethora of tools to help modders of video games, such as PXDAnimationTools for games made in Hedgehog Engine 2.

However, I specialize in technical art as a shader artist. One of the biggest examples is the well-known mod "Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite & Beyond", which I worked on with Maximillian Dood and others. I was one of the project leads, and created the shader and art style that was used on the mod.

I'm completely self-taught, having learned everything I know over the last 5 years. I'm currently seeking out jobs. Please reach out to me via LinkedIn or at kp72002@gmail.com if you would like to know more about me, or any of the projects I've worked on.
