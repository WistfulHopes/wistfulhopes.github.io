  The website of Aeryn Mu, known on the internet as WistfulHopes.<br />
---

My name is Aeryn Mu. I'm also known as Ryn, and my online handle is WistfulHopes. I'm a programmer and technical artist who works in game development and modding.

I'm a programmer who knows Unreal Engine and Unity. I program in C++, C#, and Python as a gameplay and tools developer. I'm the lead programmer for [Saturday AM Battle Manga](https://youtu.be/QYGgE_1XJ5Q). I have written my own fighting game framework in Unreal Engine 5, called [Night Sky Engine](https://github.com/WistfulHopes/NightSkyEngine), with support for industry standard features such as rollback netcode and crossplay. Additionally, I have made a plethora of tools to help modders of video games, such as [PXDAnimationTools](https://github.com/WistfulHopes/PXDAnimationTools) for games made in Hedgehog Engine 2, or [Granblue Fantasy Relink Mod Manager]().

I'm also a technical artist. One of the biggest examples is the well-known mod [Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite & Beyond](https://mvcib.com/), which I worked on with Maximillian Dood and others. I was one of the project leads, and created the shader and art style that was used on the mod. Additionally, I worked on [Saturday AM Battle Manga's](https://youtu.be/QYGgE_1XJ5Q) shaders and VFX.

Finally, I'm a reverse engineer. I've reverse engineered many Unreal Engine games, to the point that I contribute to [RE-UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS), the leading Unreal Engine modding framework. My dissasembler/decompiler of choice is Binary Ninja, but I also have Ghidra and IDA Pro experience. As a result, I'm familiar with x86 and ARM assembly code.

I'm self-taught, having learned what I know about programming over the last 5 years. I'm currently seeking out jobs. Please reach out to me via LinkedIn or at kp72002@gmail.com if you would like to know more about me, or any of the projects I've worked on.
