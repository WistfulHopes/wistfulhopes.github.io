  The website of Aeryn Mu, known on the internet as WistfulHopes.<br />
---

My name is Aeryn Mu. I'm also known as Ryn, and my online handle is WistfulHopes. I'm a programmer and artist who works in game development and modding. 

I'm a generalist who knows Unreal Engine and Unity. I can program in C++, C#, and Python as a gameplay programmer. However, I specialize in technical art as a shader artist. I enjoy bringing ideas to life, creating the systems and art for games.

I'm completely self-taught, having learned everything I know over the last 4 and a half years. I'm currently seeking out jobs. Please reach out to me via LinkedIn or at kp72002@gmail.com if you would like to know more about me, or any of the projects I've worked on.
